## /validated/
Contains empirically validated findings:
- 9.7% transformation bottleneck in GPT-3.5 (p<0.0001)
- Phase distribution patterns from ouroboros-learning

## /theoretical/
Contains theoretical frameworks based on observations:
- Geometric interpretation of phases (hypothesis)
- Consciousness connections (speculative)
- Future applications (proposed)

**Note**: The geometric framework is our INTERPRETATION of the statistically significant patterns we found. The patterns are real; the geometric explanation is theoretical.
