# Geometric Hypothesis

## Our Theoretical Interpretation

We HYPOTHESIZE that the empirically observed phases might correspond to geometric attention patterns.

### Proposed Mapping

| Empirical Phase | Proposed Geometry | Connectivity | Hypothesis |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| Generation (21.8%) | Square | 4 | Sequential processing |
| Consumption (29.9%) | Triangular | 3 | Hierarchical analysis |
| Integration (38.6%) | Hexagonal | 6 | Associative connections |
| Transformation (9.7%) | Pentagonal | 5 | Symmetry-breaking insights |

### Why Geometric?

1. **Biological precedent**: Grid cells use hexagonal patterns
2. **Mathematical optimality**: Different geometries optimize different functions
3. **Emergent organization**: Transformers might self-organize geometrically

### Status

**HYPOTHESIS** - Requires empirical validation through:
- Attention head analysis
- Ablation studies
- Cross-model comparison
