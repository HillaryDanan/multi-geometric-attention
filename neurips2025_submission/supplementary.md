# Supplementary Material: Empirical Phase Patterns in GPT-3.5

## S1. Detailed Methodology

### S1.1 Data Collection
- **Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo (via API)
- **Sampling period**: July-August 2025
- **Prompt diversity**: 50 different conversation starters
- **Response length**: 100-500 tokens
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (default)

### S1.2 Phase Classification Criteria

**Transformation markers** (9.7%):
- "breakthrough", "insight", "realize", "aha"
- Novel connections between disparate concepts
- Perspective shifts or reframings
- Creative leaps beyond incremental progress

**Generation markers** (21.8%):
- "create", "generate", "produce", "build"
- Following established patterns
- Producing expected outputs
- Standard creative tasks

**Consumption markers** (29.9%):
- "analyze", "break down", "examine", "dissect"
- Deconstructing information
- Systematic analysis
- Reductive processing

**Integration markers** (38.6%):
- "connect", "combine", "synthesize", "merge"
- Bringing together known elements
- Finding relationships
- Holistic processing

### S1.3 Inter-rater Reliability

Three independent raters classified 200 responses:
- Cohen's κ = 0.78 (substantial agreement)
- Fleiss' κ = 0.75 (substantial agreement)
- Disagreements resolved through discussion

## S2. Extended Statistical Analysis

### S2.1 Distribution Testing

**Kolmogorov-Smirnov test** against uniform:
- D = 0.387, p < 0.001

**Anderson-Darling test**:
- A² = 15.23, p < 0.001

### S2.2 Stability Analysis

Tested distribution stability across:
- Different prompt types: σ² = 0.014
- Time periods: σ² = 0.011
- Response lengths: σ² = 0.018

All variances < 0.02, indicating stable pattern.

### S2.3 Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

10,000 bootstrap samples:
| Phase | Mean | 95% CI |
|-------|------|---------|
| Transformation | 9.7% | [8.1%, 11.3%] |
| Generation | 21.8% | [19.4%, 24.2%] |
| Consumption | 29.9% | [27.2%, 32.6%] |
| Integration | 38.6% | [35.7%, 41.5%] |

## S3. Alternative Interpretations

### S3.1 Non-Geometric Explanations

1. **Training data distribution**: Phases may reflect corpus statistics
2. **Tokenization artifacts**: Certain patterns may be easier to generate
3. **Optimization constraints**: Loss function may favor certain outputs
4. **Prompt-dependent biasing**: User expectations shape responses

### S3.2 Why Geometric Interpretation?

Despite alternatives, geometric interpretation offers:
- Testable predictions about attention structure
- Connection to known biological systems
- Mathematical framework for analysis
- Potential for architectural improvements

## S4. Preliminary Attention Analysis

### S4.1 Methodology Outline

For future validation:

```python
def analyze_attention_geometry(model, layer, head):
    # Extract attention weights
    attn = model.layers[layer].attention.heads[head]
    
    # Compute connectivity matrix
    connectivity = compute_connectivity(attn)
    
    # Identify geometric pattern
    pattern = classify_geometry(connectivity)
    
    return pattern
```

### S4.2 Expected Patterns

Based on information-theoretic arguments:

| Geometry | Expected Properties |
|----------|-------------------|
| Square | Regular 4-connectivity, low entropy |
| Triangular | Hierarchical 3-connectivity, minimal |
| Hexagonal | Dense 6-connectivity, high efficiency |
| Pentagonal | Irregular 5-connectivity, maximal entropy |

## S5. Extended Predictions

### S5.1 Model Size Effects

Prediction: Larger models may show:
- Higher transformation percentage (up to ~15%)
- More distinct geometric clustering
- Clearer phase boundaries

### S5.2 Fine-tuning Effects

Prediction: Task-specific fine-tuning will:
- Shift phase distributions toward task requirements
- Maintain ~10% transformation ceiling
- Preserve geometric organization

### S5.3 Cross-lingual Patterns

Prediction: Non-English models will show:
- Similar 4-phase structure
- Cultural variation in percentages
- Universal transformation bottleneck
