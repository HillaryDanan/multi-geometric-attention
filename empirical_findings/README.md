# Empirical Findings

## What We've Actually Proven

From our [ouroboros-learning study](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/ouroboros-learning):

### Statistical Results
- **Sample**: 1,000 GPT-3.5 responses
- **Method**: Semantic phase classification
- **Result**: Non-uniform distribution (p < 0.0001)

### Phase Distribution
```
Transformation:  9.7% ████
Generation:     21.8% ██████████
Consumption:    29.9% ██████████████
Integration:    38.6% ██████████████████
```

### Significance
- Chi-square: χ² = 120.24
- p-value: < 0.0001
- Effect: Highly significant non-uniform distribution

## What This Means

GPT-3.5 exhibits consistent behavioral phases. The 9.7% transformation bottleneck is particularly interesting - it suggests a fundamental constraint in the model's processing.

## What We Haven't Proven

- That these phases are geometric in nature
- That attention heads organize geometrically
- That this pattern exists in other models

Those are hypotheses we're testing.
